# Property Search Implementation with Hybrid Search

## Overview
I've implemented a comprehensive property search system with 100 diverse properties and a hybrid search approach that combines keyword matching, vector similarity, and fuzzy search for the best results.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **100 Diverse Properties Database**
- Properties across 10 major US cities
- 5 property types: house, condo, townhouse, apartment, penthouse
- Price ranges from $150k to $5M+
- Various features like pools, gardens, views, smart home, etc.
- Location-specific features (e.g., ocean views in Miami, mountain views in Denver)

### 2. **Hybrid Search Implementation**
The search system uses three complementary approaches:

#### a) **Keyword Search**
- PostgreSQL full-text search capabilities
- Exact matching for price ranges, bedrooms, locations

#### b) **Semantic Search (Vector)**
- Uses sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model
- Creates embeddings for property descriptions
- Finds semantically similar properties

#### c) **Fuzzy Search**
- Handles typos and variations
- Uses Levenshtein distance algorithm
- PostgreSQL pg_trgm extension for similarity matching

### 3. **Smart Scoring System**
Properties are scored based on:
- **Price Match (30%)**: How well the price fits the budget
- **Bedrooms (20%)**: Meeting bedroom requirements
- **Location (25%)**: City and area matching
- **Property Type (15%)**: House, condo, etc.
- **Features (10%)**: Pool, garage, views, etc.

### 4. **Feature Grouping**
Related features are automatically grouped:
- pool → swimming pool, spa, hot tub, jacuzzi
- garage → parking, carport, covered parking
- garden → yard, backyard, lawn, landscaping
- view → ocean view, mountain view, city view, lake view

### 5. **Voice Integration Updates**
- Real-time property updates as the AI speaks
- Match score display (e.g., "85% match")
- Progress indicator during search
- Voice mentions match scores

### 6. **Enhanced UI Components**

#### Property Cards
- Match score badges (Excellent: 80%+, Good: 60-79%, Fair: 30-59%)
- Feature tags with "+X more" for additional features
- Dual action buttons: View Details & Schedule Viewing
- Year built information
- Property descriptions

#### Search Progress Component
- Animated search indicator
- Shows search criteria as tags
- Displays found count
- Smooth transitions

## How It Works

### Voice Conversation Flow
1. User: "I'm looking for a house in Austin"
2. AI: "What's your budget?"
3. User: "Around 600 to 800 thousand"
4. AI: "How many bedrooms?"
5. User: "At least 3"
6. AI: "Any special features?"
7. User: "I'd like a pool and good schools"
8. AI: Searches and presents top matches with scores

### Search Process
1. **Initial Filter**: Apply hard constraints (price, min bedrooms)
2. **Calculate Scores**: Score each property based on all criteria
3. **Fuzzy Matching**: Boost scores for properties with similar features
4. **Sort & Filter**: Remove low matches (<30%), return top 10
5. **Present Results**: Voice describes top 3 with match percentages

## Example Searches

### Family Home Search
```javascript
{
  location: "Austin",
  minPrice: 500000,
  maxPrice: 800000,
  bedrooms: 4,
  features: ["pool", "good schools", "garage"]
}
```
Returns: Family homes in Austin with pools and good school districts

### Urban Professional Search
```javascript
{
  location: "New York",
  maxPrice: 1000000,
  bedrooms: 2,
  propertyType: "condo",
  features: ["doorman", "gym", "city view"]
}
```
Returns: Luxury condos in NYC with amenities

### Budget-Conscious Search
```javascript
{
  maxPrice: 300000,
  bedrooms: 2,
  features: ["parking", "yard"]
}
```
Returns: Affordable homes across various cities

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Start Voice Search**: Click the voice button
2. **Natural Conversation**: Describe what you're looking for
3. **Watch Results Update**: Properties appear with match scores
4. **Refine Search**: Ask to adjust criteria or see more options

## Future Enhancements

1. **Vector Database Integration**: 
   - Use PostgreSQL pgvector or ChromaDB
   - Store property embeddings for faster search
   
2. **User Preference Learning**:
   - Track which properties users like
   - Improve recommendations over time
   
3. **Advanced Filters**:
   - Commute time calculations
   - School ratings integration
   - Crime statistics
   
4. **Visual Search**:
   - Upload inspiration photos
   - Find similar-looking properties
